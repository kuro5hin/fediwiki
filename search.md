# Search

GNU Social includes a basic search engine that allows for one to search
notices, groups, and people.

This can be done through the UI, or by appending the search term to one
of the URLs below (where %s is the seach term):
* Notices: `https://example.com/search/notice?q=%s`
* People: `https://example.com/search/people?q=%s`
* Groups: `https://example.com/search/group?q=%s`
